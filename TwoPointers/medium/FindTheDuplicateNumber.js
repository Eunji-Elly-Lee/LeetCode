// Array / Two Pointers / Binary Search / Bit Manipulation

// Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
// There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
// You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.
// How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
// Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
