// Array / Dynamic Programming / Sliding Window

// Given an integer array nums and two integers firstLen and secondLen,
// return the maximum sum of elements in two non-overlapping subarrays with lengths firstLen and secondLen.
// The array with length firstLen could occur before or after the array with length secondLen, but they have to be non-overlapping.
// A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

 * @param {number} firstLen
 * @param {number} secondLen
 * @return {number}
